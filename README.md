# Waste-wood-graduation-project
Reusing waste wood for an exterior wall element.
This folder contains the exterior wall element tool and other files from my graduation project at the TU Delft. 


IMPORTANT! The Exterior wall element folder must be placed in the documents folder on the pc. Otherwise the Exterior wall element tool will not work

Open the Exterior_wall_element_tool_JvE.gh in Grasshopper. Multiple plugins are required and can be downloaded from:
